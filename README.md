# DequeMinimal
This minimal Deque doesn't return an error value to handle invalid input args.
The project goal is : create a Deque extension type that includes a PanicHandler method
The benefit is minimal boilerplate code for handling deque errors when calling Get, Set, Pop, Push, Insert etc
My example is a TestSuite that tests the embedded Deque, and works in tandem with a TestRunner
